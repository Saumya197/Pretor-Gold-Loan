## Executive Summary

This project addresses the challenge of creating a successful company in France immediately following WWI, an era marked by severe economic depression. The analysis identified a unique market opportunity in the non-banking financial sector, leading to the development of **Prêtor**, a gold loan company. The business model is built on the historical stability of gold as an asset during recessions. By offering more competitive interest rates (5%) than the Central Bank (up to 7%) and leveraging a robust financial model, Prêtor demonstrates a viable and profitable path to providing essential financing to a struggling populace.

## The Business Problem & Market Context

The French economy post-WWI was in a state of crisis, presenting a challenging environment for any new enterprise. Key factors included:
* **Drastic Production Decline:** French industrial and agricultural output had fallen by 45% in 1919 compared to pre-war levels in 1913.
* **Severe Labor Shortage:** 27% of young men aged 18-27 were killed in the war, creating a massive gap in the workforce.
* **Devalued Assets:** Traditional assets like land were risky and had dropped significantly in value.

## The Solution: A Gold-Backed Lending Model

Prêtor was designed to operate as a gold loan company, using gold as a stable form of collateral when other assets were unreliable. The core value propositions were:
* **Competitive Interest Rates:** Offering loans at 5% interest, significantly lower than the central bank's rate of up to 7%.
* **Flexible Loan Terms:** Providing shorter loan periods, as brief as three months, to meet immediate needs.
* **Risk Mitigation:** The value of gold has been observed to be remarkably stable, even during economic depressions, minimizing the risk of the underlying mortgage devaluing.

## Financial Model & Case Study

A case study was modeled to test the resilience of the business against fluctuations in the price of gold. The model used historical gold prices from 1919 to 1920.

**Scenario:** A loan issued in 1919.
* **Gold Value (1919):** $19.95 / ounce
* **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** 80%
* **Loan Amount:** $15.96 (80% of $19.95)
* **Interest Rate:** 5%

After one year, the amount owed would be **$16.76**. During this time, the value of gold rose to **$20.68 / ounce** in 1920. This demonstrates a **resilient margin of $3.92** ($20.68 - $16.76), proving the model's viability even with price changes.
